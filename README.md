# Build Patch Tool

### Made with üß° by Bry üí©

This is a simple and handy GUI to help developers manage their Unreal Engine binaries on the Epic Games Store.

You can download it from the [releases page](https://github.com/brynertoma/Build-Patch-Tool/releases).

**This still requires the use of Epic's Build Patch Tool!** This app is just used as a wrapper to help simplify the process and prevent developers from having to use commands via the command line anytime they want to upload a new binary.

# Prerequisites

### 1) Epic's Build Patch Tool

[Download here](https://launcher-public-service-prod06.ol.epicgames.com/launcher/api/installer/download/BuildPatchTool.zip) but if the link doesn't work then following the instructions below:

Login to your [Dev Portal](https://dev.epicgames.com/portal) and select any one of your products in the left sidebar.

Click on `Epic Games Store` > `Artifacts and Binaries` -> `Download Tool` at the top right.

### 2) Client Key & Client Secret
In your [Dev Portal](https://dev.epicgames.com/portal) under `Product Settings`, click `General` and you should see your `Build Patch Tool Credentials` that were automatically assigned to you by Epic when you first creating your product. **Copy / paste these in a notepad for now, you'll need them later.**

### 3) Organization Id, Product Id, Artifact Id

In your [Dev Portal](https://dev.epicgames.com/portal) under `Epic Games Store` for your `Product`, select `Artifacts and Binaries` - this will take you to the same place you downloaded `Epic's BPT`. Click the `ellipses` beside the `Artifact` and select `Manage Artifact`.

In the right sidebar, click `Instruction & Credentials` and then click the `copy` icon beside the `Command line template for this artifact`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11199820/226492802-a210eb77-2e33-4cd7-b900-05d4bcfb6b26.png)

Paste the copied data into a notepad and you'll get something like this, minus the emojis and the neat formatting. You'll want to grab your `Organization Id`, `Product Id` and `Artifact Id`. Feel free to paste them in the same notepad you used earlier for your `Client Key` and `Client Secret` for now.

### ü•≥ Woohoo! You're now ready to move on! üéâ ###

# üí© Bry's üß° BPT

**DISCLAIMER: From now on I'll refer to `this` tool as `Bry's BPT` and `Epic's` tool as `Epic's BPT`.**

When the app starts up for the first time, you'll be prompted to locate Epic's Build Patch Tool that you downloaded from the steps above.

Point `Bry's BPT` to `Epic's BPT`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11199820/226488752-e1091714-89d8-401a-827b-2cb3f6ae496c.png)

Once you've done that, you should see the path to `Epic's BPT` under the `Select Build Patch Tool` button.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11199820/226489309-6edd6fb6-8828-45b0-85d0-a9a9e2fa75c6.png)

This will automatically create a `bpt-config.json` file within the same directory as `Bry's BPT`. **Do not share this file with anyone else as it stores information about your organization, client id / secret, etc.**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11199820/226490315-c79236d0-1e4f-4cfd-ac6c-70491bbd42a6.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11199820/226490002-8a184db6-c62e-4290-b7ef-5334ac974ae2.png)

Before you do anything else, copy / paste all of the IDs you saved earlier to the appropriate fields. These 5 fields are required for every type of command you'll be sending to Epic. **Make sure you `Save Config` before you do anything else!**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11199820/226494135-5a2c0784-bac8-4c71-92b9-a527ef98d4fd.png)

Now when you select the `Mode` you wish to execute, your configuration will auto-populate and you will see all of the possible arguments that this mode accepts. Assume that all arguments are `required` unless they're marked `[ Optional ]`. Attempting to execute will display an error if a `required` field is missing.

Hovering over the `i` will display a tooltip about that field. This is pulled from the [Epic Documentation](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-games-store/publishing-tools/store-presence/upload-binaries/bpt-instructions-150) as a convenience to not have to go manually look it up in case you forget what the argument is for.

Clicking the üëÅ will display the hidden fields, upon release of your click it will auto-hide the fields again to keep your goodies safe! üòä

Clicking `Save Config` will save your current configuration to the `bpt-config.json` file.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11199820/226496591-a84c276b-a464-4776-81ed-602c8f7919f1.png)

Clicking `Reload Config` will reload the last config you saved.

Clicking `Clear Config` will clear the configuration with the exception of the `Build Patch Tool Path`. **Note that this does not write to your config file. You need to click `Save Config` to save the `cleared` configuration to the `bpt-config.json` file.**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11199820/226496530-21fb5409-69a4-46b6-8bdf-3a91f46655f9.png)

The `Documentation` button will take you to `Epic's BPT docs`.

The `Github` button will bring you.. I'll let you figure that one out! üí©

# Upload Binary Example

### Uploading a packaged client build to the Epic Games Store Dev sandbox

When you `Execute`, a `command prompt` will open up without anything logging to it and all of the inputs and buttons will be disabled..
<h3>BE PATIENT!</h3>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11199820/226499770-8bd1c66c-cf1e-4239-80cc-040fc17947a4.png)

Depending on the size of your game, if this is the first time you've uploaded, there is no `diffing` being done so it may take a few minutes to a few years depending on your internet connection.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11199820/226498366-6c0157dd-7ac8-4c7f-9c80-826e95df918e.png)

Once the upload is complete you will find the uploaded binary in the `Inactive Binaries` section of your `Artifact` (the same place we visited earlier to download `Epic's BPT Tool` where we clicked `Manage Artifact`).

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11199820/226500274-8526cf11-250d-4b25-a963-baf305e46712.png)

Excuse the backwards versioning, but this is for demo purposes anyway. Notice how there's already an `Active Binary` assigned to `Windows`. This means that when someone visits the `Epic Games Store` using the `Epic Games Launcher`, they'll be able to download the game if they have a matching OS (Windows is 64bit, Win32, and MacOS). 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11199820/226500561-6ca73488-603e-419a-9b04-5a43133bfb1a.png)


If you click `Assign Platform` and then assign an OS, if there is a binary active with a matching OS you'll get a notification that it's going to be replaced by this new binary.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11199820/226500743-a7dcf4ef-d297-4fb7-88f6-d9b84b725bb8.png)

You can see the new `Binary 0.0.1` we uploaded is now the `Active` one and the `0.0.8d` version was moved to the `Inactive Binaries` section. `Inactive Binaries` are deleted after a week.
